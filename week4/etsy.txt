Upon first glance of the Etsy homepage I immediately had one thought: boring. There's really no color scheme whatsoever besides the Etsy homepage logo/link which is colored a burnt orange. I soon changed my idea of the site from boring to simple. I realized that they aren't trying to make the site look amazing; the main focus is supposed to be the user content.

My final impression, then, is that this site is simple, which is a good thing. It's fairly easy to navigate with the vertical navigation menu on the left-hand side of the homepage. And when a list item in the navigational menu is clicked then the user is brought to the main page for that list item. Within this new page there are menus along the top with different sub-categories for that particular list item, making navigating the site quite simple.

My only real problem with the site is that the main vertical navigation menu is only on the homepage. It almost feels awkward, because I found myself expecting to see the navigation on the side so I could go to other sections of the website. Alas, this was not the case and to go from, for example, "Art" to "Vintage" the user must navigate from "Art" back to the homepage and then to "Vintage", which seems redundant.
