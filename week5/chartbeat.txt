Upon first arrival at Chartbeat's website I was confused as to what I was looking at. After a few minutes on the site it was clear that the site was a tool for website owners to compile real-time data into easy to understand charts. There isn't much on the homepage but once you click the 'Demo It' link you're instantly overwhelmed.

In the demo feature of the site you are surrounded by charts and graphs and tables that all move in real time. What does it all mean? Once you play around with this page you start to understand the data that Chartbeat is supplying you with. Chartbeat tells you how long your site has been running, how many visitors you've had, how people have gotten to your site, and even the top pages within your site. They even include a 30 day free trial for users to interact with their own site as the demo pulls data from the website someecards.com. I love what Chartbeat is doing.
