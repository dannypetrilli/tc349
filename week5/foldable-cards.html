		<h2>The Process</h2>
			<p>I used the site Optimal Workshop to compile my card sorting survey. I had 6 participants take the survey, including myself. The results of the card sorting survey were fairly similar to the current architecture of the site with a few variations. For instance, my results would separate 'Create a Foldable' from the top menu bar. Another distinction is that the 'Details' category would be separate from the 'Social' category, which it is not currently. The two seem to mesh together right now, which is something I would change. The 'Feedback' card was also sorted into the 'Details' category which is contrary to its current, vertical placement on the left side of the site.</p>
			<p>All of the participants' sorts were dramatically similar. The biggest difference I found were in category titles, such as one person named the 'Shop' category 'Rewards'. Two of the 6 participants chose to group the 'Create', 'Short Film', and 'Login' cards into a category named 'Random' instead of leaving them individual. This card sorting survey wasn't particularly interesting in terms of variation. Almost every participant grouped each card into the same category, with only minor card variations.</p>
