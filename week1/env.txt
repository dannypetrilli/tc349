I started these assignments by using MacVim, and while it’s free it also seems to be the most complicated and non-user-friendly text editor I’ve used. I am not a fan of the interface, as it seems too complicated but perhaps with time I will get used to it. The second text editor I used was TextMate. TextMate seems to be far superior to MacVim, but it appears that TextMate is only free for the first 30 days. That is absolutely a drawback for me.

The third, and final, text editor I used was TextWrangler. I had used TextWrangler momentarily in the past when taking a computer science course. TextWrangler seems to incorporate the pros of MacVim, it’s price -- free, and TextMate, it’s user interface. I intend to use TextWrangler for the duration of the semester so that I don’t start by using TextMate and then have to switch over to a new editor once the trial period is over.
