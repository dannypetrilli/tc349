Upon first glance at jasonsantamaria.com I wasn’t exactly sure what it was. The white background and posts with corresponding dates white fill up 80% of the site left me thinking it was either a blog or some kind of news site. Judging from the name of the site I assumed it was probably someone’s blog. Essentially, I was correct but it seems as if his site is more than just a blog. It seems as this site is a compilation of works he’s done and works he supports.

One aspect of his site that I really admire is his logo. It seems as if an attempt to subtly incorporate his initials into the logo. I also like how his about me, contact info, and description of the site are all included when you click the “About” tab. Besides that, the site doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense. There doesn’t seem to be any real purpose, rather a cluster of books, articles, and videos. Some of these seem to have a correlation to him and some do not. His portfolio also links to his old site, which leads me to believe this is a new site and he’s still getting it up and running. All in all, I’m still pretty confused as to what his aim is with this site.
