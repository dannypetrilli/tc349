	<h2>Critique of <a href="http://panic.com/" target="_blank">Panic</a>:</h2>
	<p>Upon first arrival at Panic's site there were a few things that caught my attention. The first being their logo, which takes up a third of the page. The next item, their short, yet sweet, mission statement stating they "make super nice apps for Macs, iPhones, and iPads". My attention was in the palm of their hand at this point. I own all three of these devices and am always looking for "super nice apps". I ventured on.</p>
	<p>At this point I am starting to get a feel for what the site is about: apps. But what kind of apps? I immediately see five logos beneath their mission statement. There are no titles or descriptions for any of them, just five pictures. Once I brought my cursor over each one I saw a title for the logo and a short description. I quickly gathered that these five logos were of the apps that Panic has created. This forces the user engage in the site, which was positive for me but I know will not be the case for everyone. Most people want information spoon fed to them, and this is not what exactly what Panic does. I can see why the site would be confusing to some.</p>
	<p>When a logo is clicked it takes the user to the part of the site dedicated to that app. The first app I clicked on is called Prompt. Prompt is a SSH (secure shell) client for iPhone and iPad. So it's essentially a coding powerhouse for on-the-go which I think is awesome, to be put simply. Within each page for each of the five apps you learn what the app's purpose is and how much it costs. For me, the site is easy to navigate and with a few minutes spent exploring I knew exactly what their purpose was. I would even use their products if they weren't so expensive.</p>
