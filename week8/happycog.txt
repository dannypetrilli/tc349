Happy Cog seems like a beneficial site to those who need it. An ambiguous statement for an ambiguous site. I am confused as to what the exact purpose of Happy Cog is. The design of the site is rich and smooth but I have not a clue to what the purpose is. All I know is that they work to help their customers.

The way that they help their customers isn't completely certain to me. I'm assuming it is a consultation firm for clients in building web presence. The Happy Cog site is easy on the eyes and fairly easy to navigate, so their problem isn't in the design. It's in their mission statement. They don't come right out and say what their purpose is. That is a turn off for me.
