	<h1>Final Project Card Sorting</h1>
		<p>For my final project I intend to create a site for a local concert booking company called Livingston Underground. Livingston Underground operates in Livingston County and is ran by some of my friends. I have decided to rework their current site as the current architecture doesn't make much sense/seem relevant to the target audience.</p>
		<h2>Findings</h2>
			<p>Here is a list of all the cards I included in the survey:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>About</li>
					<li>Download</li>
					<li>E-mail Us</li>
					<li>Facebook</li>
					<li>Just Announced</li>
					<li>Twitter Feed</li>
					<li>Bands</li>
					<li>Venues</li>
					<li>Past Events</li>
					<li>Submit</li>
					<li>Twitter</li>
					<li>Upcoming Events</li>
					<li>Documentary</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Trends</h3>
				<p>Here are the average groupings of cards by all participants (including myself):</p>
				<table border="5">

		<h2>The Process</h2>
			<p>I used the site Optimal Workshop to compile my card sorting survey. I had 4 participants take the survey, including myself. The results of the card sorting survey were fairly similar to the current architecture I had in mind for the site. The site will be geared towards concertgoers and indeed must highlight necessary features. The site will revolve around the mission of the Livingston Underground company and the bands and venues in Livingston County. The chose cards to reflect the architecture I already started developing for the site and the participants chose to use every card I included.</p>
			<p>All of the participants' sorts were similar to my own. The 'Events' category was the same for each participant. As was leaving 'Documentary' and 'Twitter Feed' as their own categories. Some people chose to break the 'Connect' category into two separate categories. At this point it seems most relevant to keep the four cards in one category. Although there were only a few minor variations of categories, all findings lead me to the tables above.</p>
