I frequent a website called Bandcamp (bandcamp.com) and chose to review the mobile version of this site. Bandcamp is a site for music streaming and downloading, similar to iTunes. As far as the design of Bandcamp is concerned there are pros and there are cons. The desktop version of the homepage isn't very flattering nor is it easy to navigate but the mobile version seems to really emcompass what the desktop version is missing. The header on the mobile site is very pleasing, unlike the desktop version. The mobile homepage is broken into segments; weekly best-sellers, fan spotlight, discover, and new and notable.

The way the mobile site is broken up just seems to work. It is easy enough to navigate, while being mobile, which seems like a difficult task for a music streaming/downloading site of this nature. Bandcamp isn't for top 40 artists and musicians of that sort, it is for independent and lower-tier artists who wish to put their own music out. So a site of this caliber needs to be easy to navigate for the user or the user won't care enough to use it because generally you don't know what you're looking for when you're navigating the site. Bandcamp accomplishes this very well.

Artist pages are where Bandcamp really shines. Upon arrival on an artist's page, the user first sees a large image of the album artwork followed by a music player and then buttons to "buy now", "share", and the track listing. Following the album the page then displays the artist's profile picture, links to social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and then upcoming shows for the artist. At the bottom of the page Bandcamp displays contact information, for Bandcamp, copyright policy, privacy, and various help panels for navigating the site. Bandcamp's mobile site is visually pleasing and free of frustration.
