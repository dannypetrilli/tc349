The United Pixelworkers site isn't anything elaborate and it doesn't need to be. It is a simplistic site with everything laid out in an easy to follow and easy to understand manner. I like that each shirt has its name and price along with a picture for easy searching. Some sites will just show a picture of the shirt and then you have to click on it to see the price. This makes United Pixelworkers more efficient, in my opinion.

I also really enjoy their color scheme. The orange logo in the top left really draws attention at first arrival and gets the visitor excited about being at the site even if the visitor isn't sure exactly of why they're there. I think the large typefaces make navigating the site that much more simplistic and natural. Even the search bar is nice to use with its gigantic size.

Overall, the United Pixelworkers site is well constructed and therefore easy to navigate. The user will really have no problem finding what they need within the site. Even the pictures of the products on the site just look professional. I give the design of United Pixelworkers an 8/10 for these reasons.
