Upon first arrival at MSU's Homepage I had one thought in particular: clean. The logo is at the top of the page and clearly informs the user that the page belongs to Michigan State University. The color scheme of the page fits the school's colors (green and white). Even the navigation just seems right; it flows. The navigation bar is gray and each tab turns to a darker gray when the cursor is placed over it. Not only that but there are drop-down menus for each tab on the navigation bar so the user can easily find what they're looking for.

So if the user highlights the "Admission" tab they will see links for "Apply", "Visit", and even "Office of Admissions". Depending which page the user is on the corresponding navigational tab will be highlighted green. Below the navigation bar the user will see a few animated headlines for stories regarding the university. Finally, at the bottom of the page the user will find social media links (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Also at the bottom of the page the user will find contact information and MSU's privacy statement. All-in-all, the MSU Homepage is simple yet functional
